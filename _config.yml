          I have experience facilitating and assisting with AI4ALL Ignite Career Readiness events, specifically in conducting Resume and LinkedIn reviews, as well as participating in Opportunity Chats aimed at recruitment. I regularly held periodic check-in meetings with staff and fellow student coordinators to ensure smooth coordination and communication throughout programs. Additionally, I actively participated in debriefing meetings following the conclusion of AI4ALL Ignite Career Readiness programs to evaluate outcomes and identify areas for improvement. I provided administrative support for 2-3 AI4ALL Ignite Career Readiness classes, which included managing student communications, documenting assignments, and tracking attendance. I also gained proficiency in Salesforce by documenting student internship experiences across various AI4ALL programs. Furthermore, I effectively managed projects and tasks using the Asana work management platform, demonstrating strong organizational skills and attention to detail in project execution.

          During my pursuit of dual degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, I acquired essential skills that have significantly shaped my career, particularly in teamwork and meeting stringent deadlines. My university experience was enriching, providing me with insights into maintaining a balanced work-life dynamic. Outside of academics, I dedicated a substantial portion of my free time to serving on the committees of various clubs, including roles such as Event Coordinator and Treasurer at the UMBC Astronomy Club. These experiences were instrumental in honing my leadership and financial management abilities.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
